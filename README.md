# Inspiration
Have you ever tried to plan a big event for your friends, family, or partner and realized how chaotic it can get? From having to text multiple people same addresses, contacting people and waiting for them to respond when a sudden change in plan happens, and keeping people updated on the schedule. The list goes on and on. Wouldn't it be easier if everyone can just view a synchronized plan with a simple and intuitive interface? That's what Travely is here to do.

# What it does
Travely is a PC/mobile application that allows users to create and view synchronized plans for multi-event, multi-location, multi-day date/hangout/travel/trip. On the PC, a user can create a detailed plan that includes multiple events at different locations. Once the plan is made, they can share the plan with their friends/family/date/coworkers. Once shared, they can open up the app on their mobile devices to see a synchronized view of the plan. Any changes made to the schedule will be shown on everyone's screen so that everyone is alerted about the changes. Also, the direction button comes in really handy to make sure no one goes to the wrong Cali N Tito!

# How we built it 
We built the application using Dart with Flutter framework and Google's Firebase as the back-end for hosting and database. For the map, direction, and traffic data, we extensively utilized Google's Map/Place/Direction API.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges using Google's API. There weren't many open-source packages or documents in Flutter that helped with using Google's API, so we ran into a lot of cases where we couldn't communicate with the API properly. For example, CORS error was an error we spent hours trying to fix.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a decently sized project together in such a short amount of time with extensive use of Google's Directions/Places/Maps API. We also had one of our team members design our logo, and it came out really beautifully.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about how better we can manage projects in the future. We also got to collaboratively use Figma, and it helped tremendously during the design process. Also, we learned to use firebase's Realtime Database for the first time.

# What's next for Travely
We had a lot of ideas for our application and we are eager to continue building Travely.

## Polishing
We haven't had the chance to completely polish both PC/Mobile versions of the application. We would like to restructure some components and make some features more efficient.

## Online Community
We want to create an online community where users can share their date/hangout/trip plans online for other users to see and try with their friends and families. After they try your plans, they can react to them to allow other people in the community to see how awesome your date/hangout/trip plans are!

## Smart Suggestions
If the application goes online, we could see how others react to certain trips to give you personalized suggestions on what events are a good fit for you to help you make an awesome plan for your special one!
